Working with TensorFlow can seem intimidating at first, but this tutorial will start with the basics to ensure you have a strong foundation with the package. This tutorial will be focusing on classifying and predicting Pokémon, but the elements discussed within it can certainly be helpful when using TensorFlow for other ideas, as well. Without further ado, let's begin!\n\nFirst, let's download TensorFlow through pip. While you can install the version of TensorFlow that uses your GPU, we'll be using the CPU-driven TensorFlow. Type this into your terminal:\n\n`pip install tensorflow`\n\nNow that it's installed, we can truly begin. Let's import Tensorflow, and a few other packages we'll need. All of this course involve using the command line interface. Enter these commands to import and the necessary packages:","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-12T10:50:18.197067Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-12T10:50:18.197453Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-12T10:50:20.181278Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-12T10:50:18.197369Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-12T10:50:20.179939Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-12T11:18:56.876074Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-12T11:18:56.876487Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-12T11:19:02.709622Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-12T11:18:56.876395Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-12T11:19:02.708209Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dataset we'll be using is the compilation of stats and traits for the Pokémon video games.
